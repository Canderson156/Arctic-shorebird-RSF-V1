## a dataset that contain all shorebird observations
## a dataset that contains all goose observations
## a dataset that contain all survey plots
## a dataset that combines the two

#change variabe classes
#filter only shorebirds
#filter only geese
#filter rapid vs intensive plots (other types too???)
#list of all plot with basic metadata
