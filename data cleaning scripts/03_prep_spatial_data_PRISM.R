# compare GIS data vs excel data

## all geogrpahic data should be extracted from the GIS files as if may be unreliable in the excel spreadsheet: 


#Weird shapes in excel file - do we see the same weird shapes in GIS files? 
#do the GIS files represent what WAS done or what SHOUld have been done on paper?




#for the comparisons with the shapefiles, I think I'll want to do each type of corner seperately. 
#SW is the majority, and most of those have 4 points, althought I saw some with 2
#NE and NW ones from Arviat are single points
#most of the NA ones it appears that Isabelle just doesn't know them, there were some that it seemed weirder that they were missing



# the prism polygons perhaps should just be points. I'm not sure how this will affect analysis downstream
