## all geogrpahic data should be extracted from the GIS files as if may be unreliable in the excel spreadsheet: 

# region
# subregion
# plot coordinates
# plot area
# quality? others? what else is in the GIS files?




# compare GIS data vs excel data

#Weird shapes in excel file - do we see the same weird shapes in GIS files? 
#do the GIS files represent what WAS done or what SHOUld have been done on paper?
